# SAFE Navigator

SAFE Navigator is a web application designed to demystify startup financing. It helps founders, investors, and advisors model and understand the financial implications of SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) agreements through an intuitive, visual interface.

Our core mission is to democratize startup financing knowledge, making complex financial instruments understandable for everyone, regardless of their financial background.

## Key Features (as of Milestone 2)

*   **Dual-Mode Interface**:
    *   **Simple Mode**: A streamlined view for quick, high-level modeling.
    *   **Pro Mode**: A detailed view for modeling advanced terms like discounts and post-money SAFEs.
*   **Multi-SAFE Simulation**: Model the dilutive impact of multiple SAFE notes converting at once.
*   **Interactive Scenario Modeling**: Use sliders and templates to instantly see how different valuations and terms affect ownership.
*   **Ownership Visualization**: A clear pie chart shows the projected equity distribution among founders and investors post-conversion.
*   **AI-Powered Explanations**: Get plain-language explanations of complex financial terms or ask the AI your own specific questions.
*   **PDF Export**: Generate professional, shareable PDF reports of your financing scenarios to share with your team, advisors, or investors.
